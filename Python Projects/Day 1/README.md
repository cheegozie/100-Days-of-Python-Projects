# 🔐 Day 1 – Secure Password Generator

This is Day 1 of my **100 Days of Python – Cybersecurity Edition** challenge.

## 🚀 Project Overview
A command-line tool that generates secure random passwords using Python. It supports custom length and includes letters, digits, and symbols.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered
- Functions
- Loops
- `random` and `string` modules
- Basic security hygiene
- CLI output

## ⚙️ How to Run
Make sure you have Python installed.

```bash
python password_gen.py
```

You can also specify password length:

```bash
python password_gen.py --length 16
```

## ✅ Sample Output

```
🔐 Your Secure Password: Y$9vBfL@3x#q
```

## 💡 What I Learned
- How to define and call functions
- How to use `for` loops and `range()`
- How to combine characters from `string` and randomize them
